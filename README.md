# Least-Squares-Monte-Carlo
American option pricing using Least Squares Monte Carlo implemented in Python with the Numpy library as in Longstaff and Schwartz (2001).

The LSM_NoVR is crude Monte Carlo, i.e. without variance reduction.
LSM_BS_CV is Least Squares Monte Carlo with the European option price by Black-Scholes as a control variate.
LSM_AP is Least Squares Monte Carlo with Antithetic Variates in the random nubmer generation.
